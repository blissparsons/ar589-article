      <p>
        The High Line (also known as High Line Park) is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33 km) elevated linear park, greenway and rail trail. It was created on a former New York Central Railroadspur on the west side of Manhattanin New York City.[1] Led by landscape architecture
        firm James Corner Field Operations, the abandoned railway has been redesigned as a "living system" that draws from multiple disciplines including landscape architecture, urban design, and ecology. Since opening in 2009, the High Line has become
        an icon in contemporary landscape architecture.[3] </p>
      <p>
        The park is built on the disused southern viaduct section of a New York Central Railroad line called the West Side Line. Originating in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, the park runs from Gansevoort Street - three blocks below 14th Street - in the Meatpacking
        District, through Chelsea, to the northern edge of the West Side Yard on 34th Streetnear the Javits Center.[4] Formerly, the West Side Line went as far south as a railroad terminal at Spring Street, just north of Canal Street. However, most of
        the southern section was demolished in 1960,[5] with another small portion being demolished in 1991.[6] The High Line was inspired by the 3-mile-long (4.8 km) Promenade plantée (tree-lined walkway), a similar project in Paris completed in 1993.[7][8]</p>

      <p>
        Repurposing of the railway into an urban park began in 2006,[9][10] with the first phase opening in 2009,[11] and the second phase opening in 2011.[12] The third and final phase officially opened to the public on September 21, 2014.[13] A short stub above
        Tenth Avenue and 30th Street will open by 2018 once the first phase of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project is complete.[14] Its success has inspired cities nationwide to reimagine obsolete infrastructure as public space.[15] Additionally, the
        project has spurred real estate development in the neighborhoods that lie along the line,[16] and increased real estate values and prices along the route, the result of a "halo effect".[17] As of September 2014, the park gets nearly 5 million
        visitors annually.[2]</p>

      <h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l green lh-solid">History</h2>

      <p>In 1847, the City of New York authorized street-level railroad tracks down Manhattan's West Side to ship freight.[45] For safety, the railroads hired men called the "West Side Cowboys" to ride horses and wave flags in front of the trains.[46] However,
        so many accidents occurred between freight trains and other traffic that Tenth Avenue became known as "Death Avenue".[47][48]</p>

      <p>After years of public debate about the hazard, in 1929 the city, the state of New York, and the New York Central Railroad agreed on the West Side Improvement Project,[45] a large project conceived by Robert Moses that also included the construction
        of the West Side Elevated Highway.[49] The 13-mile (21 km) project eliminated 105 street-level railroad crossings and added 32 acres (13 ha) to Riverside Park. It cost more than US$150,000,000 (about US$2,137,791,000 today).[46][48]</p>

      <p>The High Line viaduct, then a portion of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line, opened to trains in 1934. It originally ran from 34th Street to St. John's Park Terminal at Spring Street, and was designed to go through the center of blocks
        rather than over the avenue.[46] It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to load and unload their cargo inside buildings. Milk, meat, produce, and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without
        disturbing traffic on the streets.[46] This also reduced the load for the Bell Laboratories Building (which has housed the Westbeth Artists Community since 1970[50]), as well as for the former Nabisco plant in the Chelsea Market building, which
        were served from protected sidings within the structures.[48][51]</p>

      <p>The train also passed underneath the Western Electric complex at Washington Street. This section still exists as of May 18, 2008, and is not connected with the rest of the developed park.[48][52]</p>

      <p>The growth of interstate trucking in the 1950s led to a drop in rail traffic throughout the nation. By 1960, the southernmost section of the line was demolished due to low use.[5] This section started at Gansevoort Street and ran down Washington
        Street as far as Spring Street just north of Canal Street,[53] representing almost half of the line. The last train on the remaining part of the line was operated by Conrail in 1980.[46][48]</p>

      <p>In the mid-1980s, a group of property owners with land under the line lobbied for the demolition of the entire structure. Peter Obletz, a Chelsea resident, activist, and railroad enthusiast, challenged the demolition efforts in court and tried to
        re-establish rail service on the line.[46][54] However, during the late 1980s, the north end of the High Line was disconnected from the rest of the national railroad system because it was expected that the High Line would be demolished.[55] Due
        to the construction of the Empire Connection to Penn Station, which opened in spring 1991, new tracks were routed to the new Empire Connection tunnel built underground to Penn Station. A small section of the High Line in the West Village, from
        Bank to Gansevoort Streets, was taken apart in 1991, despite objections by people who wanted to keep the High Line.[6]</p>

      <p>In the 1990s, the line lay unused and in disrepair, but the riveted-steel elevated structure was structurally sound. Around this time, the structure became known to a few urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses,
        shrubs, and rugged trees such as sumac that had sprung up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.[48][56]</p>

      <h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l green lh-solid">Reconstruction and Design</h2>

      <p>
        On June 13, 2005, the U.S. Federal Surface Transportation Board issued a certificate of interim trail use, allowing the city to remove most of the line from the national railway system. On April 10, 2006, Mayor Bloomberg presided over a ceremony that
        marked the beginning of construction. The park was designed by the James Corner's New York-based landscape architecture firm Field Operations and architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, with garden design from Piet Oudolf of the Netherlands, lighting
        design from L'Observatoire International,[9] and engineering design by Buro Happold[10] and Robert Silman Associates.[62] </p>

      <p>The New York City Department of City Planning director and Chair of the City Planning Commission Amanda Burden actively contributed to the success of project development.[63][64] Major backers included Philip Falcone,[65] Diane von Fürstenberg,
        Barry Diller, and von Fürstenberg's children, Prince Alexander von Fürstenberg and Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg.[66] Hotel developer Andre Balazs, owner of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, built the 337-room Standard Hotel, straddling the
        High Line at West 13th Street.[24]</p>

      <p>The southernmost section, from Gansevoort Street to 20th Street, opened as a city park on June 8, 2009.[11] This southern section includes five stairways and elevators at 14th Street and 16th Street.[4] Around the same time, construction for the
        second section began.[67] On June 7, 2011, a ribbon was cut to open the second section from 20th Street to 30th Street, with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and
        Congressman Jerrold Nadler in attendance.[12][68] In 2011, CSX Transportation, the then-owner of the northernmost section, from 30th to 34th Streets, agreed in principle to donate the section to the city,[66] while the Related Companies, which
        owns the development rights to the West Side Rail Yards, agreed not to tear down the spur that crosses 10th Avenue.[69]</p>
      <p> Construction on the final section was started in September 2012.[70][71] On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the High Line was held,[13][72] followed by the opening of the third section of the High Line Park on September 21, and
        a procession down the High Line.[2][73] The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts.[20] The first part, costing US$75 million,[74] which opened on September 21,[13]is from the end of the existing Phase 2 of the High Line
        to the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue.[20][75][76]</p>
      <p>The second part, the spur, was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but has changed and will provide more room to install ambitious artworks curated by the public art program.[77][78][79][80] It will also be integrated with 10
        Hudson Yards,[81] which has already been built over the High Line Spur.[82] The spur will include a plinth when it opens in 2018.[83]

      <h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l green lh-solid">Attractions</h2>
      <p>The park's attractions include naturalized plantings that are inspired by the landscape that grew on the disused tracks,[35] and views of the city and the Hudson River. The trail is made of pebble-dash concrete walkways that swells and constricts,
        swings from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the hardscape with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. "By opening the paving, we allow the plants to bleed through," said landscape architect James Corner, "almost
        as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people to stroll on, and the planting...."[3] Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former
        use. </p>

      <p>Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views.[36] The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes rugged meadow plants such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and
        coneflowers, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives. At the Gansevoort Street end, a grove of mixed species of birch already provides some dappled shade by late afternoon. Ipê timber for the built-in
        benches has come from a managed forest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, to ensure sustainable use and the conservation of biological diversity, water resources, and fragile ecosystems.[37] According to James Corner Field Operations,
        the High Line's design "is characterized by an intimate choreography of movement."[38] </p>

      <p>The High Line Park also has cultural attractions. As part of a long-term plan for the park to host temporary installations and performances of various kinds. Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and
        Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways by Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, as a series of 700 purple and grey colored glass
        panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name. Creative Time worked with
        the artist to realize the site-specific concept that emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall.[39] The summer of 2010 featured a sound
        installation by Stephen Vitiello, composed from bells heard through New York. Lauren Ross, formerly director of the alternative art space White Columns, served as the first curator for the High Line Park.[40] During the construction of the second
        phase between 20th and 30th Streets, several artworks were installed including, Sarah Sze's "Still Life with Landscape (Model for a Habitat)" a sculpture made of steel and wood, located on the line near 20th and 21st Streets; this structure was
        built as a house for fauna such as birds and butterflies. Kim Beck's "Space Available"[41] was installed on the roofs of three buildings visible from the southern end. Three 20-by-12-foot (6.1 by 3.7 m) sculptures looked like the armature of empty
        billboards, constructed like theater backdrops, so they look three-dimensional from a distance.[42][43] Also installed during the second phase of construction was Julianne Swartz's "Digital Empathy", a work that utilizes audio messages at restrooms,
        elevators, and water fountains.[44]</p>

      <h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l green lh-solid">Friends of the High Line</h2>

      <p>
        The High Line is maintained by Friends of the High Line, which was founded by area residents Joshua David and Robert Hammond in 1999.[46] The organization is largely credited with saving the structure,[84] by rallying public support for the park and convincing
        Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration in 2002 to support the project by filing a request with the United States Surface Transportation Board to create a public trail on the site.[59] </p>

      <p>Friends of the High Line also played a major role in the visual aesthetic of the High Line, holding a competition in conjunction with the city of New York in 2004 to determine the design team that would lead the project.[59] Since the park's opening
        in 2009, Friends of the High Line has held a licensing agreement with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation to serve as its primary steward.[85] As part of the agreement, Friends of the High Line is responsible for the daily operations
        and maintenance of the park, which amount to more than $5 million a year.[86]</p>

      <p> The organization has an annual operating budget of $11.5 million, in addition to capital construction and management and fundraising expenses.[46] Friends of the High Line has raised more than $150 million in public and private funds[46] toward
        the construction of the first two sections of the High Line.[86]</p>

      <p> Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million.[13] Friends of the High
        Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations.[85][87]</p>
      <p> A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.[87] Friends of the High Line
        maintains an office on Washington Street, near the park's southern end.[88] The organization has 80 full-time year-round employees and roughly 150 full-time employees during the summer season.[88] It has been run by president and co-founder Josh
        David after former Executive Director Jenny Gersten stepped down in 2014.[89]</p>
      <p> Previously, fellow co-founder Robert Hammond served as executive director until stepping down in February 2013.[86] Friends of the High Line also has a 38-member board of directors consisting of many New York City businesspeople and philanthropists,
        including Amanda Burden of Bloomberg Associates, Jane Lauder of Estée Lauder Companies, Jon Stryker of the Arcus Foundation, and Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation.[88]
