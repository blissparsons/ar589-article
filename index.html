      The High Line
    </h1>
    <h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l green lh-solid">High Line From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2>
    <p>
      The High Line (also known as High Line Park) is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33 km) elevated linear park, greenway and rail trail. It was created on a former New York Central Railroadspur on the west side of Manhattanin New York City.[1] Led by landscape architecture
      firm James Corner Field Operations, the abandoned railway has been redesigned as a "living system" that draws from multiple disciplines including landscape architecture, urban design, and ecology. Since opening in 2009, the High Line has become
      an icon in contemporary landscape architecture.[3] The park is built on the disused southern viaduct section of a New York Central Railroad line called the West Side Line. Originating in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, the park runs from Gansevoort
      Street - three blocks below 14th Street - in the Meatpacking District, through Chelsea, to the northern edge of the West Side Yard on 34th Streetnear the Javits Center.[4] Formerly, the West Side Line went as far south as a railroad terminal at
      Spring Street, just north of Canal Street. However, most of the southern section was demolished in 1960,[5] with another small portion being demolished in 1991.[6] The High Line was inspired by the 3-mile-long (4.8 km) Promenade plantée (tree-lined
      walkway), a similar project in Paris completed in 1993.[7][8] Repurposing of the railway into an urban park began in 2006,[9][10] with the first phase opening in 2009,[11] and the second phase opening in 2011.[12] The third and final phase officially
      opened to the public on September 21, 2014.[13] A short stub above Tenth Avenue and 30th Street will open by 2018 once the first phase of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project is complete.[14] Its success has inspired cities nationwide to reimagine
      obsolete infrastructure as public space.[15] Additionally, the project has spurred real estate development in the neighborhoods that lie along the line,[16] and increased real estate values and prices along the route, the result of a "halo effect".[17]
      As of September 2014, the park gets nearly 5 million visitors annually.[2]</p>

    <h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l green lh-solid">Reconstruction and design</h2>
    <p>
      On June 13, 2005, the U.S. Federal Surface Transportation Board issued a certificate of interim trail use, allowing the city to remove most of the line from the national railway system. On April 10, 2006, Mayor Bloomberg presided over a ceremony that
      marked the beginning of construction. The park was designed by the James Corner's New York-based landscape architecture firm Field Operations and architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, with garden design from Piet Oudolf of the Netherlands, lighting
      design from L'Observatoire International,[9] and engineering design by Buro Happold[10] and Robert Silman Associates.[62] The New York City Department of City Planning director and Chair of the City Planning Commission Amanda Burden actively contributed
      to the success of project development.[63][64] Major backers included Philip Falcone,[65] Diane von Fürstenberg, Barry Diller, and von Fürstenberg's children, Prince Alexander von Fürstenberg and Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg.[66] Hotel developer
      Andre Balazs, owner of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, built the 337-room Standard Hotel, straddling the High Line at West 13th Street.[24] The southernmost section, from Gansevoort Street to 20th Street, opened as a city park on June 8, 2009.[11]
      This southern section includes five stairways and elevators at 14th Street and 16th Street.[4] Around the same time, construction for the second section began.[67] On June 7, 2011, a ribbon was cut to open the second section from 20th Street to
      30th Street, with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and Congressman Jerrold Nadler in attendance.[12][68] In 2011, CSX Transportation, the then-owner of the northernmost
      section, from 30th to 34th Streets, agreed in principle to donate the section to the city,[66] while the Related Companies, which owns the development rights to the West Side Rail Yards, agreed not to tear down the spur that crosses 10th Avenue.[69]
      Construction on the final section was started in September 2012.[70][71] On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the High Line was held,[13][72] followed by the opening of the third section of the High Line Park on September 21, and
      a procession down the High Line.[2][73] The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts.[20] The first part, costing US$75 million,[74] which opened on September 21,[13]is from the end of the existing Phase 2 of the High Line to
      the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue.[20][75][76] The second part, the spur, was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but has changed and will provide more room to install ambitious artworks curated by the public
      art program.[77][78][79][80] It will also be integrated with 10 Hudson Yards,[81] which has already been built over the High Line Spur.[82] The spur will include a plinth when it opens in 2018.[83]

    <h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l green lh-solid">Friends of the High Line</h2>
    <p>The High Line is maintained by Friends of the High Line, which was founded by area residents Joshua David and Robert Hammond in 1999.[46] The organization is largely credited with saving the structure,[84] by rallying public support for the park and
      convincing Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration in 2002 to support the project by filing a request with the United States Surface Transportation Board to create a public trail on the site.[59] Friends of the High Line also played a major role
      in the visual aesthetic of the High Line, holding a competition in conjunction with the city of New York in 2004 to determine the design team that would lead the project.[59] Since the park's opening in 2009, Friends of the High Line has held a
      licensing agreement with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation to serve as its primary steward.[85] As part of the agreement, Friends of the High Line is responsible for the daily operations and maintenance of the park, which amount
      to more than $5 million a year.[86] The organization has an annual operating budget of $11.5 million, in addition to capital construction and management and fundraising expenses.[46] Friends of the High Line has raised more than $150 million in
      public and private funds[46] toward the construction of the first two sections of the High Line.[86] Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising
      funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million.[13] Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations.[85][87] A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city
      was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.[87] Friends of the High Line maintains an office on Washington Street, near
      the park's southern end.[88] The organization has 80 full-time year-round employees and roughly 150 full-time employees during the summer season.[88] It has been run by president and co-founder Josh David after former Executive Director Jenny Gersten
      stepped down in 2014.[89] Previously, fellow co-founder Robert Hammond served as executive director until stepping down in February 2013.[86] Friends of the High Line also has a 38-member board of directors consisting of many New York City businesspeople
      and philanthropists, including Amanda Burden of Bloomberg Associates, Jane Lauder of Estée Lauder Companies, Jon Stryker of the Arcus Foundation, and Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation.[88]
